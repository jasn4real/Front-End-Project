# Front End App

For my Front End Project, I will displaying the teams in the English Premier League in the current season (2022/23) and showing their stats in the season so far, while explaining how those stats are taken.

I will also discuss on the diversity of the Premier League, bringing attention to the different nationalities that exist within each team.
